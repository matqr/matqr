I'm an engineer working on smart buildings. I grew up in Peru, one of the the [best foodie places in the world](https://www.worldtravelawards.com/profile-2019-promperu-peruvian-tourism-board) and now I'm on a doctoral adventure in South East Asia.

- ðŸŽ“ I'm a graduate research student at the [BUDSLab](https://www.budslab.org/) in the National University of Singapore.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on applied machine learning for human preference and behaviour modeling in the built environment
- ðŸ˜… Fun fact: I had an *unconventional* internship and ended up working for the local government in a small island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and got my PADI diver license over there.
